# goulash-lang
A dynamically typed programming language with innovative automatic type hints.

You will need https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo to build this. Once you've installed it, simply run `cargo build --release` in the project folder and it'll generate an executable at `target/debug/goulash`.

"goulash" is the name of a hungarian dish, chosen to represent the automatic hungarian-notation style type hints.

See [file.gls](file.gls) for some examples.
